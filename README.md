# React Nanodegree Project #2: Would You Rather App

Would You Rather is a react application that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
